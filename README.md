# Total War: Warhammer 2 Tips

I will try to order this list but it will probably turn into an un ordered list as time goes on and it becomes unruly.

## General Tips

* **Corruption** can spread from certain factions, if your faction doesn't have a corruption  supporting attitude then it'll affect your **Public Order**
* Two types of settlements **Province Capital** & **Minor Settlement**
    * **Province Capital** - 7 building slots are available (Max Tier 5 buildings can be built here)
    * **Minor Settlement** - 3 building slots are available (Max Tier 3 buildings can be built here)
* **Ambush Stance** conseals your army allowing for surprise attacks in pursuing enemies.
* **Forced March** is apparently not worth it, your army enters the battle tired. If you're attacked you cannot retreat, if you lose, your whole army is gone.

## Tips for battle
* Turn **Skirmish off** & Turn **Guard mode on**
    * **Skirmish** run away from incoming troops
    * **Guard mode** Keeps your units from pursuing units when they flee
* If you have **Monstorous Units** they can seige gate of settlements so you don't need to make seige units
* When using **Calvary units** use **Charge**.
    * Charge, wait 10 secs, pull out using the hotkey J, Rinse and Repeat
* **Form a group** with units press Ctrl + G
* The grey bar below the green bar is the morale bar
  * You can drain a unit's morale via spells, charging, and combat (I assume there's other ways as well)
<br/><br/>
* **Spearmen** use arrows, infantry, and flank with cavalry to deal with
* **Cavalry** weak to spearmen, use charge, use cavalry on ranged units to have them run around
* **Ranged** can be used to setup flanks with melee button, using them as melee is a last resort
<br/><br/>
* Units level up
* You can control the **speed** at which units move in the top right
* Make sure the enemy has an escape route so you don't waste time killing a useless enemy unit
* Routing (Moving) units don't fight back
* When close enough to an enemy unit you'll want to run at them to start a charge, a charge buffs your attack
* Don't fire arrows into your enagement as you'll harm your own units
* Ranged units have ammo
  * **Ranged seige units** **hold alt and right click** to fire at the ground
  * You can **counter charges** with **charges**
* Having a group attack one unit will have them attack the closest target, so if your group consists of 3 units in a line and you're sending them after 3 more enemy units in a line they'll each choose a target closest to them (I tried to explain it as best as I could)
* **Forests** provide cover and will cloak the unit until they come out of the forest  
  ### Movement 
    * To make a **custom route** for your units to move in click on the unit and then hold shift and hold down right click and drag to where you want them to move
    * To make your units move to **waypoints** hold shift and right click multiple times to place each waypoint
    * **Left click unit then right click to move, double right click to run**
    * **Right click and drag** with a unit or a group selected to drag out different rank formations
    * Press **spacebar** to see where units will end up
    * Hit **Hotkey R** to stop units from running
    * To **rotate armies** that are setup, hold **Ctrl and press left or right on the arrow keys**
    * **Hold Alt + Left Click** then move your mouse around you'll see an outline of where your units will move to, **hold Ctrl** while doing this and you'll be able to rotate your units
    * **Backspace** stops your units movement
    * **Ctrl+G** apparently will also lock the group?
    * **Press J** to have units turn around, never do it to a group of units, just individuals, chaos will ensue
